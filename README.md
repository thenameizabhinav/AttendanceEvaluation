attendanceProject

This is a Simple Attendance Checking Project using File Handling Concepts in Java.
This Project reads a Text file which consists of Ateendance of a class .
The text file contains roll number as well as name and timestamp.

It extracts the roll number of each student in the file and check the correctness of the roll no and then give attendance.
It generates a new text file which contains roll number in sorted order and their attendance.
Finally we make a excel sheet from this newly generated text file and submit it to the class.
